# Free Testing Initiative

This project was created to manage a free COVID-19 testing initiative in my local community. It includes a request form where individuals can request a test at a specific location and time, as well as a secure admin panel which allows test facilitators to confirm test requests and refer to test location and schedule information.

I built this project using the following frameworks and libraries:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io)
